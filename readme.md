This is my personal website. [Welcome](https://peter-goa.github.io/).

This site is based on [Neo-HPSTR Theme](https://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme). Thanks a lot.

The master branch is the root of the website. The dev branch is used to build the website.

I add a [auto update function](https://github.com/Peter-Goa/autoUpdate "auto update function") for the site on pc. Although it's a simple job, Welcome to fork it.
